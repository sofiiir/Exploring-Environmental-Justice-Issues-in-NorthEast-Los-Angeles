# EDS 223 Map Making: Exploring Environmental Justice Issues in NorthEast Los Angeles (NELA) 
#### Author: Sofia Rodas
This repository explores environmental justice issues through mapping socioeconomic factors and correlating them with potentially negative environmental exposures. NorthEast Los Angeles (NELA) is an interesting case study as it is ethnically diverse and can act as a representation for what may be occuring across the United States. For the purposes of this data exploration NELA is characterized as including Eagle Rock, Highland Park, Glassell Park, Cypress Park, Atwater Village, Montecito Heights, Lincoln Heights, El Sereno, and Mount Washington (Matsuoka & Urquiza, 2021). 

Two maps were constructed to analyze an Environmental Justice issue in NELA. The first map shows the percentile of people of color in each NELA community. The second map shows the percentile of air toxics cancer risk, an Environmental Justice index that shows an estimate of lifetime exposure to carcinogens from the ambient air. There is a correlation between areas where a greater proportion of people of color reside and higher percentile of air toxics cancer risk environmental justice index.
