# EDS223: HW 1 Map Making: Exploring Environmental Justice Issues in NorthEast Los Angeles (NELA) 
#### Author: Sofia Rodas
This repository explores environmental justice issues through mapping socioeconomic factors and correlating them with potentially negative environmental exposures. NorthEast Los Anegles (NELA) is an interesting case study as it is ethnically diverse and can act as a representation for what may be occuring across the United States. For the purposes of this data exploration NELA is  characterized as including Eagle Rock, Highland Park, Glassell Park, Cypress Park, Atwater Village, Montecito Heights, Lincoln Heights, El Sereno, and Mount Washington. 

Two maps were constructed to analyze an Environmental Justice issue in NELA. The first map shows the distribution of people of color. The second map shows air toxics cancer risk, an Environmental Justice index that shows an estimate of lifetime exposure to carcinogens from the air. There is a correlation between areas where a greater proportion people of color reside and higher air toxics cancer risk environmental justice index.
